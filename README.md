# textbasedbasketball
Just a simple text based basketball game I made.

https://github.com/TimMitzen/textbasedbasketball.git

open terminal and cd into whatever folder you cloned above

type whatever python version plus basketball.py - python3 basketball.py

In the future I would like to maybe add player names and more features.

Overtime would be cool!
